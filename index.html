    <h2 style = "color: #713274;">Childhood Years</h2>
  <blockquote><blockquote><p>I was born and raised in a family filled with love and life lessons, and I am originally from <strong>Tandang Sora, Quezon City.</strong><sup>1</sup> In my daily life as a child, I was always full of joy and happiness because during those times, I had no responsibilities to think about or carry.<sup>2</sup> Back then, all I ever thought about was what games I would play throughout the day.<sup>3</sup> I would often find ways to escape the house in the afternoon because I was forced to take naps, as my parents believed that sleeping in the afternoon would help me grow faster.<sup>4</sup> But because I was stubborn and eager to play with my friends, I disobeyed my parents’ instructions to sleep, and I was often punished for it.<sup>5</sup> I was also the kind of child who was always out in the streets because that was where I spent time with other kids who brought me happiness.<sup>6</sup> This was also the time when I learned how to interact and get along with others.<sup>7</sup> Being a kid who was always out in the streets encouraged me to try the things a child should experience, and one of those was playing traditional Filipino games.<sup>8</sup> In games like <b><i>patintero, luksong baka, and tumbang preso,</i></b> I was able to show my agility and my resourceful way of playing.<sup>9</sup> There were also many times when I got involved in fights whenever the games got too heated.<sup>10</sup> I often went home with bruises and bumps because of how physical and tense the games could get.<sup>11</sup> Because of this, my parents would often scold me and remind me that they didn’t raise me to be a troublemaker, so I should never get into fights.<sup>12</sup> My family taught me how <strong>to be cheerful and how to bring happiness to others.</strong><sup>13</sup> They taught me that <strong>I should always stay positive in life</strong> because being sad will never bring me anything good.<sup>14</sup> They also taught me <strong>to have fear and respect for God.</strong><sup>15</sup> They always reminded me <strong>not to take advantage of others and to treat the people around me the right way, because we are all equal in life.<.</strong><sup>16</sup> And when it comes to school, I can say that I became quite careless with my studies despite the constant guidance and support of my parents.<sup>17</sup> Those were the times when I still didn’t see the importance of focusing on my education because my attention was still on playing, as those things made me happier.<sup>18</sup> At a young age, <strong>I learned different ways to bring joy and make my family happy.</strong><sup>19</sup> And this was the time when <strong>I started realizing that I can do more things.</strong><sup>20</sup></p></blockquote></blockquote>

  <h2 style = "color: #713274">Teenage Years</h2>
  <blockquote><blockquote><p>My teenage years were <strong>full of challenges, changes, and self-reflection.</strong><sup>1</sup> It was during this time that <strong>I had deep realizations about myself and my plans for the future.</strong><sup>2</sup> I also felt fear of the possible challenges I would face because I didn’t know if I could handle them or not.<sup>3</sup> During these times, I had no certainty about the path I would take, as I was too focused on playing online games, which were one of the things that brought me happiness.<sup>4</sup> I also met many new friends who became my companions in life; <strong>they are an important part of my journey because they shared both the good and bad experiences with me, which became lessons for all of us.</strong><sup>5</sup> As my teenage years went on, I realized that <strong>I needed to become more mature in the things I do.</strong><sup>6</sup> This was because my responsibilities in life and school were slowly increasing.<sup>7</sup> I learned <strong>to be more disciplined and to value the things I hold important in life—my time at school, with my family, my friends, and for myself.</strong><sup>8</sup> I also became more serious about my studies because <strong>I learned the importance of education.</strong><sup>9</sup> When I was in elementary school, I prioritized playing over studying.<sup>10</sup> But in high school, <strong>I focused more on my studies because I saw my potential to become an academic achiever,</strong> since I didn’t receive any academic awards when I was younger.<sup>11</sup> I also realized that if I worked hard in school, my parents would be proud of me because <strong>they wanted to see me do my best in my studies.</strong><sup>12</sup> And because of my hard work in school, from Grade 9 to Grade 12, <strong>I received the “With High Honors” award.</strong><sup>13</sup> This was an award I once thought I could never achieve, <strong>but through my perseverance, I received it consistently.</strong><sup>14</sup> I am also proud to have graduated from Senior High School as the <strong>Top 1 of our strand.</strong><sup>15</sup> These were also the times when my understanding of love grew deeper.<sup>16</sup> I made mistakes and experienced several rejections from the girls I loved.<sup>17</sup> But all of those became learning experiences for me, and <strong>I learned to become more mature when it comes to relationships.</strong><sup>18</sup> My teenage years taught me <strong>to become a better person and to keep improving myself.</strong><sup>19</sup> I got to know myself better as I faced <strong>challenges and worked hard in my studies and in life.</strong><sup>20</sup>

  <h2 style = "color: #713274">College Years</h2>
  <blockquote><blockquote><p>My current experience in college as a <strong>2nd year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student studying at the University of the East - Manila under the Computer Studies and Systems Department</strong>, is one of my biggest stages in life.<sup>1</sup> My responsibilities and time for studying increased because of the many <strong>activities, assignments, quizzes, and exams.</strong><sup>2</sup> But I was able to handle all of these because I believed in my ability to pass all my subjects and get high grades.<sup>3</sup> <b>In my first year</b>, I didn’t struggle much because my subjects were not that difficult for me yet.<sup>4</sup> Some of my classmates were the same people I had in Senior High School, and I also met new classmates who became an important part of my current college journey.<sup>5</sup> In college, I also realized that I need to be more careful in choosing my circle of friends and who I should work with in group activities.<sup>6</sup> I prefer to be with people like me who take their studies seriously because it increases the chances of getting good grades.<sup>7</sup> Being a college student is extremely stressful because of the many deadlines I have to meet.<sup>8</sup> There are times when I don’t get to sleep because I still need to finish activities with very short deadlines.<sup>9</sup> Often, I spend the whole night reviewing lessons that come with countless PDF slides.<sup>10</sup> All of this is exhausting, but I remain calm and don’t let my emotions take over because I know I just need to do everything step by step, despite working under pressure.<sup>11</sup> I also realized that <strong>I shouldn’t stay in my comfort zone and that I need to broaden my perspective in the things I do.</strong><sup>12</sup> I learned that <strong>I should focus on growing myself because, at the end of the day, I am the one who will help myself.</strong><sup>13</sup> I realized that <strong>I shouldn’t just follow what my friends do, so I created my own ways to survive college life.</strong><sup>14</sup> Being a college student made me realize that <strong>I am truly growing up, as the responsibilities I face are increasing, but all of these are part of my dreams.</strong><sup>15</sup> I can also see myself more clearly on the path I am taking, which is becoming an <b>IT specialist.</b><sup>16</sup> There are still many subjects and challenges I need to go through to achieve my dreams in life.<sup>17</sup> But I believe <strong>I can overcome all of that because I trust in my abilities and in God’s plan.</strong><sup>18</sup> In just a few years, <strong>I will finish this course,</strong> and even though we still have a thesis to complete, I believe <strong>I can pass it and fulfill the dreams I have for myself and my family.</strong><sup>19</sup> I will do my best <strong>to achieve the life I want.</strong><sup>20</sup> <i><strong>Padayon!</strong></i></p></blockquote></blockquote>
